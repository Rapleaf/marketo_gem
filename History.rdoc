=== 0.9 / 2014-MM-DD

* Bug Fixes:
  * Fix #15, where Marketo uses inconsistent camelcasing.

* Infrastructure:
  * While marketo-api-ruby may work on 1.9.2, it's being removed from Travis
    due to ongoing test failures that I can't replicate (I can't get a 1.9.2
    Ruby built, and it's no longer a supported Ruby in any case).
  * Fixed rbx tests.

=== 0.8 / 2014-04-08

* First release as marketo-api-ruby. Features a substantially restructured API.
